# DEC-QED
A computational toolbox for modeling the dynamics of three-dimensional superconducting devices and materials

DEC-QED combines gauge-invariant, flux-based formulation of electrodynamics with Discrete Exterior Calculus to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of multiscale, Josephson-based superconducting devices in microwave environments. For a detailed explanation of the technical details and key results, please check out our paper: DN Pham, W Fan, MG Scheer, and HE Tureci, arXiv:2212.12775.
